# Numerical TicTacToe

Numerical TicTacToe is an innovative variant of the traditional TicTacToe game, conceived by mathematician Ronald Graham. Instead of X's and O's, this game employs numbers 1 through 9. In this variation:

- The first player uses odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), while the second player uses even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8).
- Each number can only be used once.
- A player wins by placing three of their numbers in a row, column, or diagonal that sum to 15.
